# Piso Clone

This repository contains a basic React frontend and an Express backend. Both services use Node.js.

## Frontend

The frontend is located in `frontend/` and was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and configured to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

### Install dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Backend

The backend is located in `backend/` and provides a minimal Express server.

### Install dependencies
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### Start the server
```bash
npm start
```

Both services run independently. Start each one in a separate terminal.
